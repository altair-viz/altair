Thanks for taking the time to suggest a new feature!

Please read the guidelines below to make it more efficient to respond to your feature request, and then delete this message before submitting the issue.

- Since Altair is a Python wrapper around the Vega-Lite visualization grammar, [most feature requests should be reported directly to Vega-Lite](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/issues). You can click the Action Button of your Altair chart and "Open in Vega Editor" to create a reproducible Vega-Lite example.
- Search for duplicate issues.
- Describe the feature's goal, motivating use cases, and its expected behavior.
